**Region and Demographic Analysis**
````sql
WITH sales_agg AS 
(SELECT region, age_band, SUM(sales) as total_sales
FROM cleaned_data
GROUP BY 1,2)
SELECT region, age_band, total_sales 
FROM 
(SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY region ORDER BY total_sales DESC)
FROM sales_agg) a 
WHERE rank=1 ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

**1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?**

````sql
SELECT distinct week_date, extract('dow' from week_date) 
as day_of_week FROM cleaned_data ORDER BY 1;
````
**Answer:**

<img width="239" alt="image" src="/images/Q2a.png">

- From this, we observe entries for day of the week = 1 which is Monday.

**2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?**
````sql
SELECT DISTINCT week_number FROM cleaned_data ORDER BY 1; 
````
**Answer:**

- From this, we can see that the weeks 1-12 are missing and weeks 37-57 are missing.

**3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?**

````sql
SELECT calendar_year,
SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions
FROM cleaned_data
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
````

**Answer:**

**4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?**

````sql
SELECT region,month_number,
SUM(sales) as total_sales 
FROM cleaned_data
GROUP BY 1,2

**Answer:**

_As there are 7 regions and results came up to 49 rows, I'm only showing solution for AFRICA and ASIA._

 SELECT c1.calendar_year, 
 round(c1.couples_sales*100.0/total_sales,2) as couples_sales, 
 round(c1.families_sales*100.0/total_sales,2) as families_sales, 
 round(c1.unknown_sales*100.0/total_sales,2) as unknown_sales

**8. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?**

````sql
SELECT age_band, demographic,
SUM(CASE WHEN platform = 'Retail' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS retail_sales
FROM cleaned_data
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 1;
````

**Answer:**

<img width="650" alt="image" src="/images/Q2h.png">

The top contributors are unknown, and we‚Äôll have to examine in depth.

**9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?**

````sql
SELECT calendar_year,
platform,
ROUND(SUM(sales)/SUM(transactions), 2) AS avg_transaction
FROM cleaned_data
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2;
````

**Answer:**

<img width="636" alt="image" src="/images/Q2i.png">

We cannot use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify as we would determine the average of averages, which is incorrect and therefore we follow this approach.
